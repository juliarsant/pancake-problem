# pancake-problem
The Pancake Problem is a mathematical sorting problem that ideally sorts a stack of different sized pancakes by flipping different points on the stack with a spatula. In this case, the pancake problem is solved with an A* sorting algorithm, and uniform-cost search. The A* sorting algorithm works better than the Uniform-Cost Search algorithm due to the heuristic function it uses to find goal states.
